# Sparrow FrontEnd Application

This is the Sparrow Frontend Application v0.1

## Stack

- Flask
- Python 3
- Webpack for bundling
- ES6 Javascript
- Less Styles
- Bootstrap

## Getting Started

To get started with this Project, please clone it locally install the required dependencies:

- Install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), then go to this project's directory and run `$ nvm install` to install our required node version. Use `$ npm install` in this directory to install all node dependencies for this project.
- [PipEnv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), install Python 3. Use `$ pipenv install` afterwards to install python dependencies for this project.


We use the `src` folder for development and the `static` server is autogenerated from that.

There are two main commands you have to remember for development.

- `$ npm run watch` will start a process that will watch for file changes in the `src` folder and update the `static` directory. 
- `$ npm run serve` will start the Flask server using pipenv (remember to have this installed).

Ideally one would keep both running continuously in separate terminals, so as to differentiate when there are errors in the builder vs the server.

They look like this:

## Creating a new page

These are the steps to create a whole new page:

- Add a new route for it in the server
- Create template to be used by page. 
- If necessary, Update the webpack.config.js file to create a new bundle out of the new resources needed for this new page. An example is the form 

### Adding a new route

We are using Flask so you can use your knowledge of how to do this if you need to.

If you are going to use any of the pages available in the `userMap` then the solution for your problem will be to just define the method for the correct page like in [here](https://github.com/trysparrow/sparrow-fe/blob/5c14d32e33fe429bca0a0a66ef141764e99108e0/sparrow.py#L32-L42).

### Create template to be used by page

If your template looks like the Login Initial Page:

Or like the dashboard with a sidebar and content inside a floating box:

You can use the already existing templates under `src/pages/common`, each of these come with their own `.less` styles.

For an example of how to create a new Page reusing these common templates see the `forms` template:

- Template [template](https://github.com/trysparrow/sparrow-fe/blob/5c14d32e33fe429bca0a0a66ef141764e99108e0/src/pages/forms/forms.html#L1-L8)
- Javascript (necessary even if the line requiring styles is the only line): [example](https://github.com/trysparrow/sparrow-fe/blob/5c14d32e33fe429bca0a0a66ef141764e99108e0/src/pages/forms/forms.js#L1)
- Styles import the sidebar_template styles [here](https://github.com/trysparrow/sparrow-fe/blob/5c14d32e33fe429bca0a0a66ef141764e99108e0/src/pages/forms/forms.less#L1).
